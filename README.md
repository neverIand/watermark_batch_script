# README
A simple python script that adds watermark to images and compress them back to .rar files. Requires UnRAR.exe.
This script is just for my personal use and is developed for a specific workflow.

## Run the script
- Put the watermark inside `/_target_`
- Run `main.py` and specify the path to UnRAR.exe
- Drag .zip, .rar or .7z containing images into `/_target_` folder. You can drag multiple files at a time as long as you have enough RAM
- Wait
- The output .rar file will appear at the root folder.
